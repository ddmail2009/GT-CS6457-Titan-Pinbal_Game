Requirements (UI Components)

  - This menu scene has title of game, team name, a menu button to start and a menu button to show the credits.

Complete - The background environment of the menu should be visually appealing and animated in some fashion.
  - Two characters with a flying camera give our player a feeling that there is going to be a brutal battle on this pinball.

Complete - The menu items should be aesthetically positioned and styled.
  - no overlapping components, texts are readable and clear.
  - font is aesthetically selected. black background with white text color and shinning light remind our player this is a battlefield.
  - we use pinball icon as custom button image since it matches our total game feel.

Complete - Your menu system should be navigable with a controller or keyboard in addition to normal the mouse clicking.
  - menu items can be highlighed, clicked, go up/down.
  - although requirement suggests they should be loopable, we deicded not to do so since there are only two elements in our menu. Loopable is unnecessary.
